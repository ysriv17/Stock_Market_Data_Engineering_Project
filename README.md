# 📈 Stock Market Kafka Real-Time Data Engineering Project

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the **Stock Market Kafka Real-Time Data Engineering Project**! 🎯 This project demonstrates an **End-to-End Data Engineering pipeline** for processing real-time stock market data using **Apache Kafka** and AWS services.

We will leverage **Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL** to build a scalable and efficient data pipeline. This project is designed for Data Engineers who want hands-on experience with real-time streaming technologies. 🔥

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Project Workflow**

🔹 Real-time stock market data is streamed via **Apache Kafka**\
🔹 Data is processed and stored in **Amazon S3**\
🔹 **AWS Glue Crawler** catalogs the data\
🔹 **AWS Athena** enables querying of structured data\
🔹 Data is visualized and analyzed using SQL-based queries

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### **Programming Language**

- 🐍 **Python**

### **Cloud Services (AWS)** ☁️

- 🗂️ **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** - Data Lake Storage
- 🔍 **Athena** - Serverless Query Engine
- 🔄 **Glue Crawler** - Automated Data Cataloging
- 📑 **Glue Catalog** - Metadata Management
- 💻 **EC2** - Compute Instances for Kafka

### **Streaming & Processing**

- 🔥 **Apache Kafka** - Real-time Data Streaming Platform

## 📊 Dataset Used

You can use **any stock market dataset**, as our focus is on building the data pipeline rather than the dataset itself. If you’d like to use the dataset from the reference project, here’s the link: 📂 [Index Processed CSV](https://github.com/darshilparmar/stock-market-kafka-data-engineering-project/blob/main/indexProcessed.csv)
